Description

Toolset Types let’s you add custom post types, custom fields and custom taxonomies to the WordPress admin. A convenient dashboard lets you control everything from one place.


COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION, POWERFUL API, SIMPLE GUI FOR NON-CODERS

If you’re an experienced PHP developer, you’ll appreciate Types comprehensive fields API.

You will find detailed guides on adding custom post types, fields and taxonomy to the front-end, including:

Creating templates for single custom posts
Creating templates for custom post type archives
Creating custom user profiles
Create taxonomy term archives
and more.

Too much technical stuff to learn? The full Toolset package lets you build complete WordPress sites from within the admin dashboard.

CUSTOM FIELDS FOR CONTENT, TAXONOMY TERMS AND USERS

Types lets you add custom fields for posts (meaning, WordPress posts, pages and custom content types), taxonomy terms and users. You can add any field types to different user profiles.

ACCESS CONTROL FOR FIELDS

Using Access, you will be able to control what fields different users can edit and view. This way, you can make some field groups read-only for certain users, and fully-editable for other users.

For example, when you build a membership site, the site admin will be able to change membership levels for everyone and users will see their membership fields as read-only.
